# Magic-8-Ball
## Codecademy PHP Project
### Aim:
Write a code for an online Magic 8 Ball in PHP.
### Project Brief:
‘The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice.
In this project, you’ll be creating a function that can answer any “yes” or “no” question. Your Magic 8 Ball will take in any “yes” or “no” question (as a string) and give a psychic (random) answer.’
### How it Works:
The code prompts the user to enter a question. It then returns a random number which is assigned to a Magic 8 phrase to respond to the question.
